# This is a .gitignore file, which is used to specify which files and directories
# should be ignored by Git, a popular version control system.
#
# By adding files or directories to this file, Git will not track or include
# them in the repository, which can be useful for excluding temporary files,
# build artifacts, or other files that don't need to be version-controlled.
#
# Each line in this file specifies a file or directory pattern to ignore.
# For example, the line ".DS_Store" tells Git to ignore any files with the name
# ".DS_Store", which are created by the Mac OS X Finder.
#
# For more information on how to use .gitignore files, see the official Git
# documentation: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
