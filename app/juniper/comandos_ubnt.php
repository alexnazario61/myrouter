<?php

// This is a simple PHP script with no code inside the body.
// It is currently not doing anything and can be used as a starting point
// for a new PHP script.

// To add functionality to this script, you can start by defining variables,
// functions, or classes within the body of the script.

// For example, you might define a variable like this:
$myVariable = "Hello, world!";

// Or, you might define a function like this:
function myFunction() {
  // Do something here
}

// Or, you might define a class like this:
class MyClass {
  // Define properties and methods here
}

// Once you've added some functionality to the script, be sure to update
// the comments to reflect the new behavior.
