`a rewritten version of the code with improved formatting and organization for readability:`


In this version, I have:

* Added a shebang line to indicate the script should be run using the Python 3 interpreter
* Removed unnecessary comments about the version of the code
* Combined multiple import statements into a single line for each module
* Added blank lines to separate the import statements from the code implementation for better readability.
