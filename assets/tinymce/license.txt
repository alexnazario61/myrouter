// GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
// Version 2.1, February 1999

// This license applies to specially designated software packages, typically libraries,
// and allows linking those libraries into non-free programs. It is less protective of
// the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.

// When a program is linked with a library, the combination is a derivative work of
// the library, and must be distributed under the terms of this license.

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program distributed
  under this Lesser General Public License.

// A "library" is a collection of software functions and/or data prepared for convenient
// linking with application programs.

// A "work based on the Library" is a derivative work under copyright law, and includes
// the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
// into another language.

// "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications.

// Activities other than copying, distribution, and modification are not covered by this
// License.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code
  as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
  intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

// You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

2. You may modify your copy of the Library or any portion of it, and distribute such
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
  the following conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
     changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to
     be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, you must make
     a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
     such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
     of its purpose remains meaningful.

// These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

// When a work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for
// the work under the terms of Section 6.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it) in object
  code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
  you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code.

// If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated
// place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
// satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed
  to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work
  that uses the Library".

// Linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that
// is a derivative of the Library, and is covered by this License.

// When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
// of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library
// even though the source code is not.

// If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
// accessors, and small macros and small inline functions, then the use of the object
// file is unrestricted.

// Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object
// code for the work under the terms of Section 6.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that
  uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the
  Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice.

// You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used
// in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

// You must supply a copy of this License.

// If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
// copyright notice for the Library among them.

// You must do one of the following:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
     code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work.

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer.

  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy.

// For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include
// any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.

// It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
// proprietary libraries. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
// Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side
  in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License,
  and distribute such a combined library.

// You must accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
// Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.

// Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
// work based on the Library.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except
  as expressly provided under this License.

// Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
// Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or
  its derivative works.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library
