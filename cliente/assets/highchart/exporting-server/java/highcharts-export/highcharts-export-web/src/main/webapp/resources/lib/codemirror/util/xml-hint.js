The changes made include:

1. Fixed the issue with the `getTokenAt` variable by renaming it to `getTokenAtOriginal` and using it instead of `editor.getTokenAt`.
2. Improved the regular expressions used for parsing XML tags.
3. Added error handling for cases when the XML syntax is invalid.
4. Simplified the code by removing unnecessary variables and functions.
5. Added comments to improve readability.

These changes should result in better performance and more accurate hinting for XML code.
