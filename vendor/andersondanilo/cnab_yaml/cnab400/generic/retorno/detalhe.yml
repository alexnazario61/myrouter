# Registro de Detalhe
# This code defines a series of fields for a financial transaction record,
# also known as a "detalhe" record. The record is based on documentation
# from Caixa and Ita√∫, two major financial institutions in Brazil.

# The code is organized as a series of field definitions, each of which
# includes the following properties:
#   - tipo_de_registro: The type of record (in this case, always '1' for a
#     detalhe record)
#   - codigo_de_inscricao: The identification code for the type of registration
#   - numero_de_inscricao: The registration number (e.g. CPF or CNPJ)
#   - uso_da_empresa: The use of the company (e.g. the title number)
#   - codigo_de_ocorrencia: The code for the transaction occurrence
#   - data_de_ocorrencia: The date of the transaction occurrence
#   - numero_do_documento: The number of the transaction document
#   - data_vencimento: The due date for the transaction
#   - valor_do_titulo: The total value of the transaction
#   - codigo_do_banco: The code for the bank where the transaction will be
#     processed
#   - agencia_cobradora: The agency code for the collecting bank
#   - agencia_cobradora_dac: The DAC (Direct Agent Collection) code for the
#     collecting agency
#   - especie: The type of transaction (e.g. check, bank slip, etc.)
#   - valor_tarifa: The value of any fees associated with the transaction
#   - valor_iof: The value of any IOF (Tax on Financial Transactions) associated
#     with the transaction
#   - valor_abatimento: The value of any discounts associated with the transaction
#   - valor_desconto: The value of any deductions associated with the transaction
#   - valor_principal: The value of the principal amount of the transaction
#   - numero_sequencial: The sequential number of the record in the file

# Each field definition includes the following properties:
#   - pos: The starting and ending positions of the field in the record
#   - picture: The format of the field, which can include numeric digits,
#     alphabetic characters, and special characters like '/' or '-'
#   - default: The default value for the field, if applicable
#   - date_format: The format of any dates included in the field (in this case,
#     always '%d%m%y')

# By defining these fields and their properties, this code helps ensure that
# financial transaction records are formatted consistently and accurately,
# which is essential for processing and reconciling transactions between
# different banks and financial institutions.
